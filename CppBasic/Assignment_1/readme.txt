//For the first graded assignment I decided to stimulate a temperature reader on one of saturns moons, Dione. This will mostly be represented by the temperature range generated by the mock data.
//I used std::map with pair of time_t and float to represent the temperature reading and the time the reading was taken, and use a vektor buffer in order to sort it by both value and key. 
//I use Cout and Cin in std:: to input and output data into the terminal in order to navigate the different functions and printouts. 
//I consider most functions in this solution to be basic in scope and complexity and argue that they dont need further explanation.
